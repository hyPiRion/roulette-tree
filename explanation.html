        <p>In this text, I'll explain the <strong>dynamic roulette wheel
        problem</strong>, along with one solution to the problem, namely
        the <strong>roulette tree</strong>. Its speed is asymptotically faster
        than any other standard structure solving the same problem. However, as
        constant factors and average runtimes are more imporant in practice, we
        will also compare the roulette tree empirically against other
        solutions.</p>
        <h2>The Dynamic Roulette Wheel Problem</h2>
        <p>Many people already know what a roulette wheel is, and what it is
        used for: You have a circle, divided into some number of slots. The
        different slots usually have the same size and thus have same
        probability of being chosen in a random spin. Having different sizes on
        different slots is not unheard of, but is less common: The result is
        that the larger slots have higher probability of being picked, whereas
        smaller slots have lower probability.</p>
        <p>In the real world, roulette wheels are
        (usually) <strong>static</strong>: Slots aren't removed, added or
        resized. Consequently, static roulette wheels are very easy to
        simulate.</p>
        <p>A <strong>dynamic</strong> roulette wheel on the other hand, have the
        possibility to resize, insert or remove elements on the fly. I'll focus
        on fast insertion and removal, as resizing seems to be of limited
        use.</p>
