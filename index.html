        <h1>Roulette Tree</h1>
        <p>A roulette tree (<em>rtree</em>) is a data structure aimed to speed
          up selection phases in evolutionary algorithms, specifically when one
          pick individuals for a new generation based upon fitness-proportionate
          selection methods. It is asymptotically better than current solutions,
          and will consequently run faster for large populations.
        </p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The general problem can be described as follows: You have a
        population of individuals, where you want to pick some percentage of the
        population based on how fit they are (their <em>fitness</em>). However,
        you would avoid picking a single individual multiple times, and you want
        to to have randomness so you don't always pick the top \(n\) best
        individuals all the time (to keep diversity in the population).</p>
        <p>As an example, let's say we have three different objects: \(A\),
        \(B\) and \(C\). \(fit(A)=3\), \(fit(B)=2\) and \(fit(C)=1\). Then, on
        average, \(A\) will be picked \(^3/_6\) of the times, \(B\) will be
        picked \(^2/_6\) of the times, and \(C\) will be picked \(^1/_6\) of the
        times.</p>
        <p>The way this is usually done is by simulating a roulette wheel: We
        list all the individuals we have, and let the individual hold a piece
        of the roulette wheel proportional to the individual's fitness. To pick
        an individual, we pick a random number and let the individual which
        contains the number in its fitness interval. See the figure below for
        an example.</p>
